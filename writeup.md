The Project
---

## If you have already installed the [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) you should be good to go!   If not, you should install the starter kit to get started on this project. ##

**Step 1:** Set up the [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/fbf77062-5703-404e-b60c-95b78b2f3f9e/modules/83ec35ee-1e02-48a5-bdb7-d244bd47c2dc/lessons/8c82408b-a217-4d09-b81d-1bda4c6380ef/concepts/4f1870e0-3849-43e4-b670-12e6f2d4b7a7) if you haven't already.

**Step 2:** Open the code in a Jupyter Notebook

You will complete the project code in a Jupyter notebook.  If you are unfamiliar with Jupyter Notebooks, check out [Udacity's free course on Anaconda and Jupyter Notebooks](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud1111) to get started.

Jupyter is an Ipython notebook where you can run blocks of code and see results interactively.  All the code for this project is contained in a Jupyter notebook. To start Jupyter in your browser, use terminal to navigate to your project directory and then run the following command at the terminal prompt (be sure you've activated your Python 3 carnd-term1 environment as described in the [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) installation instructions!):

`> jupyter notebook`

A browser window will appear showing the contents of the current directory.  Click on the file called "P1.ipynb".  Another browser window will appear displaying the notebook.  Follow the instructions in the notebook to complete the project.  

**Step 3:** Complete the project and submit both the Ipython notebook and the project writeup
